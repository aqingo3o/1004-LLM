If you are not sure where something should go, **starting in your own subfolder ;)**

## Commit Messages
Please avoid commit messages like `update`, `test`, or `haha py`.  
A short, descriptive sentence helps others (and future you) understand what changed.

In general, try to use **clear and commonly understood language** when writing commit messages.

For example:
- `Fix typo in interface README`
- `Update installation steps for Llama2-7b`
- `Add notes for local LLM setup`
